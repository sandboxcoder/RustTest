# Description
When I created this project, I wanted to see what these core math functions would look like in *Rust* instead of C++/C# (where I've implemented something similar here for [example](https://github.com/sandboxcoder/CSharpRayTest)).

# Prerequisites

Rust installed

# How to Run

`cargo run .`
